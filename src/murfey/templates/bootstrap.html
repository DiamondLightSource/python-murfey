<h2>Installing a Linux Environment</h2>
<h3>Installing Cygwin</h3>
<p>
  If you already have a Cygwin install that you would like to preserve, rename
  it so that it doesn't get overwritten (something like "cygwin64-old").
</p>
<p>
  Download the Cygwin setup executable using this
  <a href="{{ proxy_path }}/cygwin/setup-x86_64.exe">mirror</a>, and then run
  the following from a terminal (both Command Prompt and Windows Powershell
  work)
</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace">
    $ setup-x86_64.exe -O -R C:\cygwin64 -s {{ request.url.scheme }}://{{ netloc }}{{ proxy_path }}/cygwin -P curl,python3,rsync -q
</pre>
<p>
  This will install Cygwin with the minimum packages needed to run Murfey. The
  Cygwin install command will occasionally hang after completion. In such an
  event, just hit Enter to return to a normal command prompt window.
</p>

<h3>Installing MSYS2</h3>
<p>
  MSYS2 is a lightweight Linux environment which provides compiler support for
  the more modern programming languages used by Murfey's package dependencies.
</p>
<p>
  The Murfey server supports the forwarding of download requests to client PCs
  that cannot access the wider internet. Download the MSYS2 setup executable
  using this
  <a href="{{ proxy_path }}/msys2/distrib/msys2-x86_64-latest.exe">mirror</a>,
  and run the executable using the default settings. This will install it to
  C:\msys64.
</p>
<p>
  By default, MSYS2 comes with preset lists of mirrors and servers that it
  installs its packages from. These will need to be disabled, and replaced with
  URLs of the same format that point to the Murfey server the client PC is
  connected to.
</p>
<p>
  These lists can be found in the following folder, if the default installation
  options were chosen:
</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace">
    C:\msys64\etc\pacman.d\mirrorlist.{environment}
</pre>
<p>This is an example of how the URL to the Murfey server should look like:</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace">
    Server = https://repo.msys2.org/mingw/x86_64/  # Original URL
    Server = {{ request.url.scheme }}://{{ netloc }}{{ proxy_path }}/msys2/mingw/x86_64/  # Murfey URL
</pre>
<p>
  MSYS2 comes with multiple environments, but UCRT64 is the most modern one. In
  order for the Murfey client to be able to install and run its dependencies
  properly, the following packages will need to be installed in the UCRT64
  environment. This can be achieved using the following commands:
</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace">
    $ pacman -Syu
    $ pacman -S rsync
    $ pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-python-pip
    $ pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-rust
</pre>
<p>
  Other utility packages such as
  <span style="font-family: monospace">vim</span> can also be installed by
  running
  <span style="font-family: monospace">pacman -S &lt;package-name&gt;</span>.
  You can browse the other packages supported by
  <span style="font-family: monospace">pacman</span> by searching the repo using
  <span style="font-family: monospace">pacman -Ss &lt;package-name&gt;</span>
</p>

<h2>Setting Up Python</h2>
<p>
  Once Python and pip are installed in the terminal, you have the option to
  install Murfey in either the base environment or a virtual environment. The
  base environment is simpler, but uninstallation of the Python packages in the
  future could potentially interfere with the base environment's functionality.
</p>
<h3>Setting Up a Virtual Environment</h3>
<p>To set up a virtual environment, run the following commands:</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace">
    $ pip install virtualenv --index-url {{ request.url.scheme }}://{{ netloc }}{{ proxy_path }}/pypi --trusted-host {{ netloc }}
    $ virtualenv your-env-name  # Create the virtual environment
    $ source your-env-name/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
</pre>
<h3>Installing Murfey</h3>
<p>
  You can install Murfey in the Python environment (the base one or a virtual
  environment) in either the Cygwin or UCRT64 terminal using the following
  commands:
</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace">
    $ pip install murfey[client] --index-url {{ request.url.scheme }}://{{ netloc }}{{ proxy_path }}/pypi --trusted-host {{ netloc }}
</pre>
<pre>
  If you wish to install the client-side dependencies needed to run Murfey via the web UI, replace <span style="font-family: monospace;">murfey[client]</span> with <span style="font-family: monospace;">murfey[client,instrument-server]</span>.
</pre>
